DOUGLAS LOGIN AUTOMATED TESTS WITH SELENIUM

In this project I have implemented automated tests using SELENIUM.

On https://www.douglas.de/mydouglas/login you will find the registration and login form.

I have checked the following requirements:

    As an user with correct credentials I would like to be able to login to the webshop
    As a user I would like to receive an error message, if I enter wrong credentials.
    As a user, I would like to be able to reset my password if I forget my credentials.

INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THE FOLLOWING VERSIONS TO RUN THIS APPLICATION: <br>
selenium-java-3.141.59<br>
jre1.8.0_241<br>
Tess4J-3.4.8-src<br>
Chrome Version 80.0.3987.149 (Oficial Build) (64 bits)<br>
