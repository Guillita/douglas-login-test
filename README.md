DOUGLAS LOGIN AUTOMATED TESTS WITH SELENIUM

In this project I have implemented automated tests using SELENIUM.

On https://www.douglas.de/mydouglas/login you will find the registration and login form. 

I have checked the following requirements:

- As an user with correct credentials I would like to be able to login to the webshop
- As a user I would like to receive an error message, if I enter wrong credentials.
- As a user, I would like to be able to reset my password if I forget my credentials.

INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THE FOLLOWING VERSIONS TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:
selenium-java-3.141.59
jre1.8.0_241
Tess4J-3.4.8-src
